ABSTRACT = {Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) techniques have been under continuous research and increasingly applied in a diverse range of tasks. One area in particular concerns its application in navigation tasks of assistive mobile robots, with the aim to increase the mobility and autonomy of people suffering from mobility decay, or severe motor impairments, due to muscular, neurological, or osteoarticular decay. Therefore, in this work, having in view navigation tasks for assistive mobile robots, an evaluation study of two MOTs by detection algorithms, SORT and Deep-SORT, is presented. To improve the data association of both methods, which are solved as a linear assignment problem with a generated cost matrix, a set of new object tracking data association cost matrices based on intersection over union, Euclidean distances, and bounding box metrics is proposed. For the evaluation of the MOT by detection in a real-time pipeline, the YOLOv3 is used to detect and classify the objects available on images. In addition, to perform the proposed evaluation aiming at assistive platforms, the ISR Tracking dataset, which represents the object conditions under which real robotic platforms may navigate, is presented. Experimental evaluations were also carried out on the MOT17 dataset. Promising results were achieved by the proposed object tracking data association cost matrices, showing an improvement in the majority of the MOT evaluation metrics compared to the default data association cost matrix. In addition, promising frame rate values were attained by the pipeline composed of the detector and the tracking module.},

abstract = {This paper discussed a human following mobile robot system using laser range scanner. The laser range scanner is very useful device for getting the environmental information around the robot. We developed the human detecting algorithm that the laser range scanner to detect the shins of the target person. When the laser range scanner scans the person's shin, the shape of the section of the shin shows parabola shape of the convex below. The mobile robot can detect and follow the target person based on the positions of both shins. Since the laser range scanner detects the obstacles, the system has the collision avoidance functions. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated by several performance tests.}
